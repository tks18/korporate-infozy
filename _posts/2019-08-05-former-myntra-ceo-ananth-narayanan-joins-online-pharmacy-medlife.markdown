Ananth Narayanan, who quit Flipkart owned Myntra after the acquisition by Walmart, has now joined Medlife as its CEO.
<br>
<br>There were rumours that Narayanan left his position as Myntra Jabong&rsquo;s CEO because of his misalignment with Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy. Even while Narayanan was working for the company, reports said that he could join the Indian OTT platform Hotstar. 
<br>
<br>However, he is now part of <keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="online-pharmacy" actualkeyword="online pharmacy">online pharmacy</keyword> startup. Medlife was founded in 2014 by Tushar Kumar and Prashant Singh, and helps patients and doctors manage their files online. 
<br>The company claims to perform 20,000 deliveries across India and is reportedly in talks with pharma giant Cipla for a funding round. Cipla could invest â‚¹170 crore in the e-pharmacy startup. There were also reports that 
SoftBank too was looking at investing in the startup.
<br>
<br>Bengaluru-based Medlife had also acquired its competitor 
Myra Medicines earlier in May 2019, expanding its deliveries to 22 cities in India.
