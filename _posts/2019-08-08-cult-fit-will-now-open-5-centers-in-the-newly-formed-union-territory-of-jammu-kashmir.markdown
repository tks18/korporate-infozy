Indian fitness startup Cure.fit which runs fitness chain Cult.fit, is now all set to open five centres in the newly formed of union territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir.
<br>
<br>This comes in days after the Indian government brought the valley under its rule, and divided the state into two union territories. It also scrapped Article 370 and Article 35A which were holding back investments as it forbid anyone who isn&rsquo;t a Kashmiri, from owning land in the valley. 
<br>
<br>Now, that situation has changed. &ldquo;We are happy to announce our foray into the newly created union territory of Jammu &amp; Kashmir through cult.fit fitness centres. The recent announcement from the Government of India potentially opens up opportunities for our business growth and also create job opportunities. We intend to foray with five cult.fit fitness centres and keep on working to expand our offerings,&rdquo; said Ankit Nagori, co-founder, cure.fit.
<br>Curefit was founded in 2016 by Myntra co-founder Mukesh Bansal and former Flipkart Chief Business Officer Ankit Nagori. It has fitness centers under the <keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Cultfit" keynameseo="cultfit" actualkeyword="cultfit">Cultfit</keyword> brand and a health app called Curefit. It also has diagnostic centers called Carefit and yoga and meditation centers called mindfit. 
<br>
<br>In three years, the startup registered 4 lakh users for curefit, with 180 centers across Bengaluru, Delhi NCR, Mumbai and Hyderabad. All these provide an annual revenue of $100 million. The company now plans to grow to 800 centers by 2020.
