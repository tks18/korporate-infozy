Paytm&rsquo;s Japanese subsidiary PayPay has managed to net 10 million users in ten months. 
<br>SoftBank is one of the major investors in Paytm. In 2017, Softbank had made its biggest bet in the Indian ecosystem by pumping in $1.4 billion in Paytm.

<br>Paytm is not the only Indian startup backed by Softbank which went to Japan. Ritesh Agarwal&rsquo;s OYO where Softbank is a key investor, entered the Japanese market, thanks to its famous backer. In April 2019, OYO announced its partnership with SoftBank Corp and SoftBank Vision fund to launch Oyo Hotels Japan.
