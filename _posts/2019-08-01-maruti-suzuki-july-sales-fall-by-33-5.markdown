 <li>It has done worse than market estimates of 20.9%.</li>
 <li>India&rsquo;s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki&rsquo;s profits for the first quarter of FY20 also fell by 27.3%</li>
Maruti Suzuki has sold 109,264 units in July 2019, registering a steep 33.5% fall in sales compared to the same month in the previous year. On a monthly basis, its July sales have fallen by 12.3% from its June. 
<br>Maruti&rsquo;s sales are worse than what the market expected. Market research firm Emkay Global forecasted that its year-on-year sales would fall by 20.9%.  
<br>This fall is in spite of increasing discounts. Bowing down to the intense sales pressure, Maruti had also been increasing its &lsquo;total cash discounts&rsquo; offered to consumers. While Alto models saw an 8% increase in discounts as compared to June, the Celerio Automatic and Dzire Diesel versions saw a steep increase of 23% and 27% respectively.
<br>India&rsquo;s largest car manufacturer Maruti Suzuki&rsquo;s profits fell by 27.3%. It total sales for the first quarter of FY20 fell by 17.9% as compared to the same quarter last year.
<br>
<br>July brought no cheer for carmakers who are hoping for a possible turnaround. &ldquo;Volume performance is expected to remain weak across segments due to a high-base effect, increasing cost of vehicle ownership, monsoon deficit and financing issues,&rdquo; said a report by Emkay Global.
