 <br>Weak monsoons, sluggish auto sales and global cues are eating into India&rsquo;s economic growth. Calling it a &lsquo;triangulation&rsquo; of downside risks, rating agency CRISIL cut the country&rsquo;s growth estimates by 0.2% to 6.9% for the current financial year.
<br>
<br>
<br>This year, India's growth might be less than the 14-year record average of 7%. Like 
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/Narendra-Modi-has-a-new-problem-big-corporates-and-moneybags-are-angry/articleshow/70450878.cms">many corporates</a>, the agency too is blaming the government.

<br>
<br>&ldquo;Given the crosswinds, the sops announced so far might not be enough to pitchfork growth in this fiscal to, or above 7% per annum,&rdquo; said Ashu Suyash, managing director of CRISIL said in a report on India, which was ominously titled - &lsquo;Uphill Trek&rsquo;.
<br>
<br>
<br>Just two years back, in 2017, the country clocked in an impressive 8.2% growth which was the fastest in the decade. This was followed by a cyclical downturn which came from policy initiatives along with

<strong>No loans, slow sales<br></strong>
<br>
<br>Indians are consuming less, which is affecting companies. This year&rsquo;s average revenues were at 8%, which is starkly lower than the double-digit growth seen in the last two years.
<br> 
Six Indian blue-chip companies have declared earnings so far - most of them lack the 'markets mojo'
<br>
Sales are also affected by crisis in the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). As they are unable to access funding, they are also disbursing less, slowing down the growth engine. 
<br>
One of the many sectors affected by the lack of finance from shadow banks are automobiles.
<br>
&ldquo;Sales volume in the automobiles sector will be impacted by a trifecta &ndash; of spurt in costs due to changes in regulation, tightening liquidity, and moderating income growth. Somber farm incomes will also weigh on rural-led segments such as FMCG,&rdquo; said Prasad Koparkar, Senior Director, CRISIL Research.
<br>
<strong>Where do we go?<br></strong>
<br>The crucial question remains---can the government do something to change the falling fortunes? It sees that even if it helps stimulate the economy, it would either fall short and won&rsquo;t last long either.
<br>
&ldquo;Given the fiscal constraints, public spending is unlikely to have the heft to pull growth above 7%. And some of the recent, and much-needed, reforms would pay off only over the medium term. There would, therefore, be some near-term onus on monetary policy to stimulate. But how effective that can be is the big question,&rdquo; said Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist, CRISIL.
