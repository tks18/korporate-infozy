It&rsquo;s not uncommon to hear stories of taxi drivers taking on extra shifts to make a little more money. But, it also makes them sleepy while they are behind the wheel, multiplying risks.
<br>
<br>Yandex.Taxi, the largest taxi service in Russia that merged with Uber last year, doesn&rsquo;t want tired drivers behind the wheel. So it&rsquo;s going to use facial recognition to keep drivers from taking on rides if they&rsquo;re exhausted.
<br>
<br>The facial recognition technology is going to watch for signs of exhaustion &mdash; like blinking, yawning and slumped posture &mdash; using a total of 68 facial points, according to Bloomberg.
<br>Yandex has already tested the technology by mounting the device on a 100 cars in Moscow and has plans to expand it to several thousand cars in its fleet.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Impetus on risk<br></strong>
<br>Accidents that involve taxis have surged by 25% in Moscow last year. 
<br>The Russian capital saw a total of 764 car accidents in 2018 resulting in a total of 23 deaths &mdash; and Russian legislators are pointing the finger that taxi companies.
<br>
<br>There&rsquo;s already a draft law on the table that puts the Russian government in charge of monitoring taxi apps like Yandex and Uber to boost safety.
<br>
<br>While this may keep taxi drivers for taking on more rides using Uber and Yandex, there are still other taxi services that will allow them to be on call &mdash; like Gett, Taxi Saturn and Taxi Maxim. 
<br>
<strong>Lessons for India</strong>
<br>
<br>In India, the situation isn&rsquo;t too different with taxis accounting for nearly 60% of the traffic on roads. In 2018, as many as 149,00 people died due to road accidents as many as 465,000 accidents were reported. 
<br>
<br>On a global scale, India accounts for 11% of all global road accident deaths.
<br>Having regulations in place to curb sleepy drivers on the road could help India achieve its target of cutting road fatalities in half by 2020, as per the Brasilia declaration. 
<br>
<br>&ldquo;Ola, Uber and private cab drivers, in order to extra money, accept rides at night too, after putting in a hard day at work. As they are sleepy, they fail to pay attention to the road, thus causing accidents,&rdquo; P Harishekaran, Additional Commissioner (Traffic) in Bengaluru told the New Indian Express.
<br>
<br>Most drivers are working 18-hour shifts to reach targets and hone in on incentives offered by the companies. And, even that isn&rsquo;t going too well with earnings taking a dip as more people sign up to a part of the ride hailing gig economy.
